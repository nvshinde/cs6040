The following sequence can be used to generate a pair of rules-file and the corresponding input-file.

% make
% ./rules16 inpfile2 101 100
% ./inputs inpfile2 outfile2

inpfile2 will have 100 rules with 2 fields. The trie structure will be constructed for this input.

outfile2 will have 300 input field values, for identifying the rule based on the trie structure.
